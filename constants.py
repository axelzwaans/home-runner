As you slowly get up, you realise something...
You were supposed to be in Dublin for a family event!
Which starts in 7 hours!
If you don't make it, you'll be in heeps of trouble...

You better hurry up, how do you want to get to the airport, bus or taxi?
"""

TAKE_BUS_TEXT = """
You took a bus!

You sit down next to a peculiar looking gentleman
You notice the man is staring at you, but you don't respond...
As the bus makes its way to the airport, you continue to ignore the staring man...
Finally, you decided you've had enough, and you confront him!

%s : "Can I help you???"
Man: "..."
Man: "..."
Man: "Are you talking to me?"
% : "Yes obviously I am talking to you! You are staring at me!"
Man: "Oh yes, I was, but I was really just wondering something..."
% : "Wondering what?"
Man: "Well, you look very smart, and I need help with something"
Man: "I forgot the security questions for my Disney+ account, and now I cannot log in "
% : We've all been there...
Man: "Would you mind helping me out?"
% : *reluctantly takes headphones out of ears* "sure..."
Man: "Thanks! Here are the questions!...
Man: "You will need to get at least 2 out of 3 right!"

You took a taxi

Axel: "To the airport please, and step on it!"
Taxi driver: "Speed limit is 55mph..."
Axel: "Yeah okay never mind..."

As you make your way to the airport
The driver seems to be a chatty one!
So you smile and nod and look out the window
As the city landscape passes you by...

Taxi driver: "Here we are!"
Axel: "Great, how much will that be?"
Taxi driver: "55 euros please"

You slide your credit card into the machine
And you realise you forgot the last digit of your pin code
You start to sweat
If you guess wrong, the taxi driver will probably drive you to a police station
You have 3 guesses before your card gets blocked!

Axel: "Here goes nothing, I am sure that it is a number between 0 and 4..."

The man is grateful that he's now able to log into his Disney+ account

PIN CORRECT

You can't believe it, you got it in %s guesses!
You say goodbye to the chatty taxi driver
And you make your way into the airport...
Luckily, you booked a ticket during the taxi ride,
So you go straight through to your gate.
But first you need to get through security!
You check to see which line might be quicker.
The line on the left seems to be going quicker...
But the line on the right seems to have less people in it...

Your card is blocked!

You slowly look up to the taxi driver
He knows you can't pay the fare

Taxi driver: "I am taking you to the cops!"
Taxi driver: "They will know what to with you"

As the driver speeds away
You look back towards the airport
And realise you won't see your family for a while...
You think to yourself...
...
...
...
This sucks but at least it's a good excuse to get out of a family event!
